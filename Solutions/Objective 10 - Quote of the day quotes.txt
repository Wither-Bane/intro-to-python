When you can't find the sunshine, be the sunshine.
The grass is greener where you water it.
Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace.
Instead of thinking about solving your whole life, just think about adding additional good things one at a time.
An arrow can only be shot by pulling it backward. When life is dragging you back with difficulties, it means it's going to launch you into something great.
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.
