#•	Asks the user to enter the diameter of a circle.
#•	Asks the user to enter the arc angle.
#•	Outputs the radius of the circle (diameter divided by 2).
#•	Outputs the area of the circle (3.14 multiplied by the radius squared).
#•	Outputs the circumference of the circle (3.14 multiplied by the diameter).
#•	Outputs the arc length (circumference multiplied by the arc angle, divided by 360).
